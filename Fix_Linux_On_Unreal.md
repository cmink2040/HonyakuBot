# Fixing Linux errors

Because the code was built on windows, if you are linux, you must manually compile the C++ files from scratch. Otherwise,
this will create an error. This can be done with the following command: 

~/Linux_Unreal_Engine_5.3.2/Engine/Build/BatchFiles/Linux/Build.sh Linux Development -Project="~/Documents/HonyakuBot/HonyakuBot.uproject" -TargetType=Editor

Please replace the uproject location and unreal engine location manually and run the command.
